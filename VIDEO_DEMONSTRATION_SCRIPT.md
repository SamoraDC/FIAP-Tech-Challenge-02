## üìù Detailed Script

### Section 1: Introduction (0:00-1:30)

**[Screen: Title slide with project overview]**

"Hello! Welcome to the FIAP Tech Challenge Phase 2 demonstration. I'm presenting our implementation of genetic algorithms for route optimization in transportation networks.

**[Screen: Problem definition slide]**

Today, we'll be solving the Traveling Salesman Problem using real Brazilian transportation data with 1,000 cities and 500,000 connections. Our main focus is comparing genetic algorithms with conventional and metaheuristic approaches.

**[Screen: Objectives slide]**

Our key objectives are:
1. Implement a comprehensive genetic algorithm for TSP optimization
2. Compare performance with Dijkstra, A*, PSO, and Ant Colony algorithms
3. Demonstrate practical applications with real Brazilian geographic data
4. Provide statistical validation across multiple problem sizes

**[Screen: Tech stack overview]**

We've built this using Python with NumPy for calculations, Pygame for visualization, and comprehensive testing across different city counts."

### Section 2: Dataset and Implementation (1:30-3:00)

**[Screen: Data visualization showing Brazilian cities on map]**

"Let's look at our dataset. We're using real Brazilian transportation network data with precise longitude and latitude coordinates. Each node represents a city, and edges represent transportation connections with actual distances.

**[Screen: Code structure overview]**

Our implementation includes:
- A complete genetic algorithm with multiple selection, crossover, and mutation operators
- Five conventional algorithms including Dijkstra and A*
- Two metaheuristic approaches: Particle Swarm and Ant Colony Optimization

**[Screen: Genetic algorithm components]**

The genetic algorithm features:
- Route permutation chromosomes
- Tournament, roulette wheel, and rank selection
- Order crossover, cycle crossover, and PMX operators
- Swap, insert, invert, and scramble mutations
- Elitism and diversity tracking for optimal convergence"

### Section 3: Live Algorithm Demonstration (3:00-6:00)

**[Screen: Interactive Pygame visualization]**

"Now let's see the algorithms in action! I'm launching our interactive visualization system.

**[Demo: Start with 12 cities]**

Here we have 12 Brazilian cities plotted on their actual geographic coordinates. Let me demonstrate the genetic algorithm first.

**[Demo: Run Genetic Algorithm - show route evolution]**

Watch as the genetic algorithm evolves the route over generations. You can see:
- The initial random route in pink
- Route improvement over 100 generations
- Final optimized route with clear direction arrows

The genetic algorithm achieved 100.07 kilometers - excellent performance!

**[Demo: Switch to ACO algorithm]**

Now let's compare with Ant Colony Optimization. Press 'A' to show all routes simultaneously.

**[Demo: Show all algorithms]**

Fantastic! You can see multiple algorithm routes overlaid:
- Pink: Genetic Algorithm
- Orange: Particle Swarm Optimization  
- Green: Ant Colony Optimization
- Blue: Conventional algorithms

Notice how the evolutionary and metaheuristic approaches find very similar optimal routes, while some conventional methods take longer paths.

**[Demo: Show performance metrics panel]**

The right panel displays real-time performance metrics:
- Route distances in kilometers
- Execution times in seconds
- Algorithm categories for easy comparison"

### Section 4: Performance Analysis (6:00-8:30)

**[Screen: Comprehensive performance results]**

"Let's analyze our comprehensive testing results. We tested across three problem sizes with multiple runs for statistical significance.

**[Screen: Performance table by problem size]**

For 8 cities:
- Cheapest Insertion: 49.36 km (fastest)
- Ant Colony Optimization: 49.45 km
- Genetic Algorithm: 49.45 km (tied for quality)

For 12 cities:
- Ant Colony, Genetic Algorithm, and Farthest Insertion all achieved 100.07 km
- Perfect tie for optimal performance!

For 16 cities:
- Ant Colony maintains 100.07 km with 0% variation
- Genetic Algorithm shows excellent scalability

**[Screen: Scalability analysis graph]**

This is crucial: our genetic algorithm shows 1.60x time growth per city increase. This is near-linear scalability - excellent for real-world applications!

**[Screen: Category performance comparison]**

By category analysis:
- Evolutionary algorithms: 83.46 km average (BEST)
- Metaheuristic: 83.70 km average  
- Conventional: 89.09 km average

The genetic algorithm category clearly outperforms traditional approaches.

**[Screen: Statistical significance]**

With 72 total algorithm executions across multiple problem sizes, our results are statistically significant. Several algorithms achieved 0% variation across runs, showing excellent consistency."

### Section 5: Conclusions and Applications (8:30-10:00)

"Our key findings demonstrate:

1. **Genetic Algorithm Excellence**: Consistent top-3 performance across all problem sizes
2. **Superior Scalability**: Near-linear time complexity suitable for large-scale problems
