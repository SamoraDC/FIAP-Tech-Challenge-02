# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a FIAP Tech Challenge Phase 2 repository focused on implementing genetic algorithms for optimization problems. The challenge requires designing, implementing, and testing a system that uses genetic algorithms to solve complex optimization problems.

## Project Structure

The repository contains:

- `Desafio/` - Contains the project requirements document (Tech Challenge - 5IADT - Fase 2.pdf)
- `docs/` - Educational materials on genetic algorithms (5 PDF files covering introduction to genetic algorithms)
- `data/` - data for use on the project

## Project Requirements

Based on the Tech Challenge documentation, this project must:

1. **Problem Definition**: Choose a real optimization problem that can be solved using genetic algorithms (e.g., route optimization, resource allocation, neural network design)
2. **Implementation**: Develop a complete genetic algorithm system with proper documentation
3. **Testing**: Demonstrate algorithm effectiveness and compare results with conventional methods
4. **Documentation**: Provide complete project documentation including problem description, implementation details, result analysis, and conclusions
5. IMPORTANT: You are at a Windows Terminal

## Deliverables Required

- **Source Code**: All scripts and code used in genetic algorithm implementation, and compare results using the `Particle Swarm Optimization`, `Ant Colony Optimization` , `Djikistra`, `A*`
- **Documentation**: Detailed document describing the problem, approach, results, and conclusions
- **Video**: 10-minute explanatory video demonstrating practical application and discussing results
- **Repository**: Code must be available on GitHub with "Tech Challenge" naming
- **Submission**: PDF file containing YouTube video link and GitHub repository link

## Development Guidelines

- Focus on implementing specific genetic algorithm functions rather than explaining general genetic algorithm theory
- Cannot use the same theme presented in class
- Must demonstrate the algorithm working in the explanatory video
- Video should be clear, objective, and focused on the specific implementation
- No PDF report or slide presentation required beyond the documentation

## Important Notes

- This is a group project worth 90% of the grade for all phase disciplines
- Must show algorithm functioning in the explanatory video
- Videos should be uploaded to YouTube
- Repository should be named "Tech Challenge"
- Student information should be in video description, not in the video itself

## Common Development Tasks

Since this repository currently contains only documentation and no source code, development will involve:

1. Using the data on `data/` for implementing the solution
2. Implementing genetic algorithm components (selection, crossover, mutation, fitness evaluation) with `Particle Swarm Optimization`, `Ant Colony Optimization` , `Djikistra`, `A*`
3. Creating test cases and performance comparisons
4. Documenting implementation and results
5. Creating demonstration visualization with `Pygame`

## Language and Framework Selection

Use Python, and it's frameworks for handling this project
