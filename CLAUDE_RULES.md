7 Rules of Claude

First, think about the problem, read the codebase to find the relevant files, and write a plan in tasks/todo.md.

The plan should include a checklist of tasks that you can mark as completed.

Before you start working, reach out to me and I will review the plan.

Then, begin working on the tasks, checking them off as you go.

At each step of the way, please give me a detailed explanation of the changes you made.

Make each task and code change as simple as possible. We want to avoid massive or complex changes. Each change should impact the codebase as little as possible. It all comes down to simplicity.

Finally, add a review section to the todo.md file with a summary of the changes made and any other relevant information.
